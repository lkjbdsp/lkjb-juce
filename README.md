# lkjb JUCE fork
This is a fork of the [JUCE repository](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE) based on the 5.4.3 release. It contains some minor changes like Projucer being configured for GPL projects and disabled analytics. This repository is used as submodule by all lkjb open source plugins to make building the plugins as easy as possible.

Please visit the JUCE repository or [JUCE homepage](https://juce.com) for further information about JUCE.
